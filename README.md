# AWS-Need-for-Speed

This repository contains code for AWS DeepRacer functions and classes. The code is written in Python and includes reward functions, and classes.
The code is designed to be used with AWS DeepRacer and can be used to train decent models on first attempt. The files are named after the resultant
model produced from that reward function. The file 'sampelrewardfunctions.py' contains a collection of some othe simple reward functions that
could be used as a starting point and for inspiration.
